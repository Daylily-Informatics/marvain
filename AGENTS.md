# ALWAYS RUN THIS: source marvain_activate when in the repo root directory and when starting a new terminal so you have the cli tools available. 

use AWS_PROFILE=daylily and AWS_REGION=us-east-1 and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

*NEVER* work around terminal issues by circumventing this rule.  If you find yourself doing so, ask for help.
